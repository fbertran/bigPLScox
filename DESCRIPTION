Description: Provides Partial least squares Regression and various regular, sparse 
    or kernel, techniques for fitting Cox models for big data. Provides a Partial 
    Least Squares (PLS) algorithm adapted to Cox proportional hazards models that 
    works with 'bigmemory' matrices without loading the entire dataset in memory. 
    Also implements a gradient-descent based solver for Cox proportional hazards 
    models that works directly on 'bigmemory' matrices.     
    The 'bigPLScox' framework was presented by Bertrand and 'Maumy' (2023)
    at Joint Statistical Meetings 2023 (Toronto, Canada) and 'BioC2023' (Boston,
    USA), highlighting fitting and cross-validating PLS-based Cox models to censored big data.
